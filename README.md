# Visualized Bubble Sort

A program to visualize bubble sort algorithm and create animated GIF. This is the result:

![](bubble.gif)

**Required ImageMagick to be installed.**

To run the algorithm and generate GIF:

```
make run
```

The output GIF will be very large (around 8.5 MB), so we need to optimize it:

```
make optimize
```

The output should be around 250 KB.
